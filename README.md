    Campus sleeping, birds a-tweeting,
    Surly students go a-creeping,
    "Wake up, Debbie, no time to spare,
    your late homework has gone somewhere!"

    "Doggone it Richard, my work was nick'd,
    and this may sound like one big trick,
    But I've had quite the week you see:
    Big buff cats and men frosty.
    You must think I'm being slick,
    But my homework?
    'twas eaten by a dog, you Dick!"

Debbie's Dog Dilemma is an adventure game 
that is quite far from the mundane 
(if we do say so ourselves).
Every day since the day you were born you have 
been practicing to play this game. You already 
know how to play.

But to control our plucky protagonist Debbie, 
use one of those KEYBOARD thingamajigs.

Arrow Keys  -    Move Debbie in four directions.
         Move cursor to select options.
Spacebar    -    Interact, confirm, touch.
Escape      -    Check your phone to save and
         adjust options.
        
         A combination of keys must be 
         used to play the piano.

This game has been specially crafted to tickle you
in all the right places.
Please enjoy.
